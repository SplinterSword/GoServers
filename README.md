# WebServers
This is my WebServers GO repository made only for practicing and learning purposes.

This includes all the requirments from a restAPI server like :-
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Database Management
- Providing different end points for different fuctions

I did not use any database management system like mongodb or sql. Instead I stored my database.json file which is created automatically when the server is started, I decided to do this so as to clear my concepts of how I should structure and store data in a database and clearing my database management concepts.
